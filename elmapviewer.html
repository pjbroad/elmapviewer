elmapviewer - A map viewer for the Eternal Lands MMORPG 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>elmapviewer</b>
[ <i>resourcefile</i> ] 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
Eternal Lands is a FREE MMORPG (massively
multi-player online role playing  game). This program displays Eternal Lands
maps and allows the user to navigate the maps using map links.  Users game
map marks are also displayed and can be filtered using a search function.
 elmapviewer was written as an experiment in the use of both the Python
language and the Pygame modules.  It suits my personal use and I release
it in the hope it may  be useful to others.  I am not a Python or Pygame
expert as I think you can tell from the code :) 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Map link information</a></h2>
The
map links are defined in the mapdata file included in the source archive.
For each map, the size, type and parent map are specified using the form
&lt;filename&gt;: &lt;game x size&gt; &lt;game y size&gt; &lt;type ie - or PK&gt; &lt;parent map filename&gt;.  The
sizes correspond to the maximum coordinates viewable on the map inside
the game.  From version 0.4, the viewer no longer needs the map size to be
defined in the link information.  The size is read directly from the elm
files that come with the game. Any lines following this initial line, until
the next map name line, define links to other maps.  The format of these
link lines is &lt;top left x&gt; &lt;top left y&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;filename of map to link
to&gt;.  The coordinates and sizes are related to the actual size of the map
image file.  You can get this information by right clicking on a map, first
the top left corner, second the bottom right corner.  A cyan box will be
drawn and the coordinates printed on the status line. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>User Map link information</a></h2>
Using
the same syntax as the main map file, the user map link information file
~/.elmapviewer.usermapdata can optionally provide addition links.  This file
is included to allow private links to be stored.  For example if you find
a secret location and don&rsquo;t want to spoil the joy of discovery for other
people.  You can add new maps and add more links to existing maps.  For existing
maps defined in the main map file, you do not need to repeat the existing
links or map information.  Just add a line with &lt;map name&gt;: and lines with
link box coordinates and the map to link to. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Function Keys</a></h2>
The keyboard
function keys can be configured (in the resource file) to provide a short
cut to maps of your choice.  Simply add the key name and desired map in
the form "F1 = map2.bmp".  The provided resource files contain a couple of
examples.  F1 to F15 can be configured in this way. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Using map marks located
on a website</a></h2>
Game player Moraf suggested it would be useful if the map viewer
could access map marks located on a web site.  This would allow groups to
share marks.  I thought this was a nice idea so have added it.  You create
a directory on your web server and use it to store the map mark files you
want to share.  In addition to these standard format, standard named mark
files, you need one extra file, called "maplist". This lists all the maps
for which you have mark files on you server.  For example, the maplist file
could contain the line "map2.bmp" then the file "map2.elm.txt" will be in
the server directory and contain mark information.  You must specify each
file in the list on a new line of text.  The configuration file contains
the directory URL and any user authorisation username/password required
for access.  Ctrl+TAB can be used to cycle though local, web and both settings
for displayed and search map marks. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>resourcefile</i> </dt>
<dd>Optionally specify
the name of the resource file.  This file stores program configuration options.
 The file defaults to .elmapviewer.rc in your HOME directory.  An example
rc file is provided with the code and will be copied to your home directory
when you first run the viewer. 
<p> </dd>

<dt>At least three values in the resource file
should be checked/modified :- </dt>
<dd>
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>mapdir</i> </dt>
<dd>Specifies the directory for the Eternal
Lands maps. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>moremapdir</i> </dt>
<dd>Specifies an additional directory to look for map
bmp files.

</dt>
<dd>Specified the full path to your favourite text editor. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>showgametime</i> </dt>
<dd>Disabled
by default.  When enabled, during startup elmapviewer will access the Eternal
Lands main web page and read the current game time.  This time will then
be displayed in the title bar of the mapviewer window.  The website time
does not appear to be that accurate so the game time is re-read once an
hour. 
<p> </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Command Summary</a></h2>

<p> 
<dl>

<dt><i>i/o/f</i> - zoom in/out/full </dt>
<dd>Zoom program window in (make
bigger), out (make smaller) and full screen. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>b</i> - toggle boxes </dt>
<dd>Toggle display
of link boxes.  Even when not display, the links are  still active. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>l</i> - edit
links </dt>
<dd>Opens the link files mapdata and ~/.elmapviewer.usermapdata in the
editor you have configured in the resource file.  It is recommended to use
the later file to configure your own, private links. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>m</i> - toggle map marks
</dt>
<dd>Toggles/cycles the display of game mark text through three colours (chosen
to have varying contrast for varying maps) and not displayed.  Note: map
marks will be display while searching even if turned off using this option.

<p> </dd>

<dt><i>e</i> - edit map marks </dt>
<dd>Opens the in-game mark file for the current map in the
editor you have configured in the resource file.  WARNING: changes made
in these files will affect in game marker display. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>n</i> - map notes </dt>
<dd>Creates
or opens a non-game file for you to make notes associated with the current
map.  The editor you have configured in the resource file will be used. 
The files are stored in the same directory as your in-game mark files. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>c</i>
- edit config </dt>
<dd>Opens the configuration file for elmapviewer in the editor
you have configured in the resource file. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>r</i> - reload data </dt>
<dd>Reloads map link
information and mark data. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>bs</i> - back map </dt>
<dd>Moves back to the previous map.
 Many previous maps are remembered so you can retrace your steps. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>home/end</i>
- islands </dt>
<dd>Home takes you straight to the Seridia map, End to Irilion. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>l-click</i>
draw boxes </dt>
<dd>Allows you to draw link boxes that can be added to either mapdata
or  ~/.elmapviewer.usermapdata (later recommended).  The coordinates required
to go into the file are written in the status line.  If you have enabled
a copy program, the same information will be copied into your window managers
copy buffer (clip board). 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>r-click</i> select </dt>
<dd>Allows you to select a function
with the mouse pointer.  That is links or some menu options.  Normally the
mouse cursor will change when you hover over a link. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>middle-click</i> </dt>
<dd>Shows
link information, the destination of the link. 
<p> 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>w</i> - walk time </dt>
<dd>Enters the
walk time calculation sub menu.  This function allows you to measure the
approximate time it will take, in-game, to walk between to locations.  A
mouse right click will draw a point, a second click will  draw another
point and a joining link.  The walk time total will then be display in the
status line.  If you right click on the map again, another point will be
display and another connecting line added - the walk time  updated.  You
can move between maps and keep adding to the walk time total. To start a
new line without resetting the total walk time or changing maps, hold down
control and right click the mouse.  A new point will be display but no connecting
line drawn and no addition to the total walk time made.  This is useful
if you intend to use teleports etc.  To exit the walk time function press
ESC, to reset the time to zero and clear the lines press w. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i></i> \ - search </dt>
<dd>\
will enter the map name search function.  As you type, your text will be
displayed in the status bar and map names or titles matching the text will
be found.  The number of maps matching the name is displayed with the index
of the current map - i.e. (map 3 of 6).  You can cycle through and display
the matching maps using the up and down arrow keys.  Starting the search
string with the ^ character will anchor the search string to the start of
the map name.  Pressing TAB will cycle though options to limit the search
to maps in Seridia, Irillion or all maps.  Press Backspace to delete the
last search string character, ESC  to exit the search function. 
<p> </dd>

<dt><i>/</i> - search
