.SH NAME
elmapviewer - A map viewer for the Eternal Lands MMORPG

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B elmapviewer
[
.I resourcefile
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Eternal Lands is a FREE MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing 
game). This program displays Eternal Lands maps and the users game data.  It
allows the user to navigate the maps using map links.  It was written as an
experiment in the use of both the Python language and the Pygame modules.  It
suits my personal use and I release it in the hope it may  be useful to others. 
I am not a Python or Pygame expert as I think you can tell from the code :)

.SH Map link information
The map links are defined in the mapdata file included in the source archive.
For each map, the size, type and parent map are specified using the form
<filename>: <game x size> <game y size> <type ie - or PK> <parent map
filename>.  The sizes correspond to the maximum coordinates viewable on the
map inside the game.  Any lines following this initial line, until the next
map name line, define links to other maps.  The format of these link lines is
<top left x> <top left y> <width> <height> <filename of map to link to>.  The
coordinates and sizes are related to the actual size of the map image file. 
You can get this information by right clicking on a map, first the top left
corner, second the bottom right corner.  A cyan box will be drawn and the
coordinates and size printed on the status line.

.SH User Map link information
Using the same syntax as the main map file, the user map link information file
~/.elmapviewer.usermapdata can optionally provide addition links.  This file
is included to allow private links to be stored.  For example if you find a
secret location and don't want to spoil the joy of discovery for other
people.  You can add new maps and add more links to existing maps.  For
existing maps defined in the main map file, you do not need to repeat the
existing links or map information.  Just add a line with <map name>: and lines
with link box coordinates and the map to link to.
