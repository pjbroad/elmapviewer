.SH NAME
elmapviewer - A map viewer for the Eternal Lands MMORPG

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B elmapviewer
[
.I resourcefile
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Eternal Lands is a FREE MMORPG (massively multi-player online role playing 
game). This program displays Eternal Lands maps and allows the user to navigate
the maps using map links.  Users game map marks are also displayed and can be
filtered using a search function.  elmapviewer was written as an experiment in
the use of both the Python language and the Pygame modules.  It suits my
personal use and I release it in the hope it may  be useful to others.  I am
not a Python or Pygame expert as I think you can tell from the code :)

.SH Map link information
The map links are defined in the mapdata file included in the source archive.
For each map, the size, type and parent map are specified using the form
<filename>: <game x size> <game y size> <type ie - or PK> <parent map
filename>.  The sizes correspond to the maximum coordinates viewable on the map
inside the game.  From version 0.4, the viewer no longer needs the map size to
be defined in the link information.  The size is read directly from the elm
files that come with the game. Any lines following this initial line, until the
next map name line, define links to other maps.  The format of these link lines
is <top left x> <top left y> <width> <height> <filename of map to link to>.  The
coordinates and sizes are related to the actual size of the map image file.  You
can get this information by right clicking on a map, first the top left corner,
second the bottom right corner.  A cyan box will be drawn and the coordinates
printed on the status line.

.SH User Map link information
Using the same syntax as the main map file, the user map link information file
~/.elmapviewer.usermapdata can optionally provide addition links.  This file
is included to allow private links to be stored.  For example if you find a
secret location and don't want to spoil the joy of discovery for other
people.  You can add new maps and add more links to existing maps.  For
existing maps defined in the main map file, you do not need to repeat the
existing links or map information.  Just add a line with <map name>: and lines
with link box coordinates and the map to link to.

.SH Function Keys
The keyboard function keys can be configured (in the resource file) to provide a
short cut to maps of your choice.  Simply add the key name and desired map in
the form "F1 = map2.bmp".  The provided resource files contain a couple of
examples.  F1 to F15 can be configured in this way.

.SH Using map marks located on a website
Game player Moraf suggested it would be useful if the map viewer could access
map marks located on a web site.  This would allow groups to share marks.  I
thought this was a nice idea so have added it.  You create a directory on your
web server and use it to store the map mark files you want to share.  In
addition to these standard format, standard named mark files, you need one extra
file, called "maplist". This lists all the maps for which you have mark files on
you server.  For example, the maplist file could contain the line "map2.bmp"
then the file "map2.elm.txt" will be in the server directory and contain mark
information.  You must specify each file in the list on a new line of text.  The
configuration file contains the directory URL and any user authorisation
username/password required for access.  Ctrl+TAB can be used to cycle though
local, web and both settings for displayed and search map marks.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I resourcefile
Optionally specify the name of the resource file.  This file stores program
configuration options.  The file defaults to .elmapviewer.rc in your HOME
directory.  An example rc file is provided with the code and will be copied to
your home directory when you first run the viewer.

.TP
At least three values in the resource file should be checked/modified :-

.TP 5
.I mapdir
Specifies the directory for the Eternal Lands maps.

.TP 5
.I moremapdir
Specifies an additional directory to look for map bmp files.

.TP 5
.I userdir
Specifies the directory for the users EL settings.

.TP 5
.I editor
Specified the full path to your favourite text editor.

.TP 5
.I showgametime
Disabled by default.  When enabled, during startup elmapviewer will access the
Eternal Lands main web page and read the current game time.  This time will then
be displayed in the title bar of the mapviewer window.  The website time does
not appear to be that accurate so the game time is re-read once an hour.

be display in the status line.  If you right click on the map again, another
point will be display and another connecting line added - the walk time 
updated.  You can move between maps and keep adding to the walk time total.
To start a new line without resetting the total walk time or changing maps,
hold down control and right click the mouse.  A new point will be display but
no connecting line drawn and no addition to the total walk time made.  This is
useful if you intend to use teleports etc.  To exit the walk time function
press ESC, to reset the time to zero and clear the lines press w.
