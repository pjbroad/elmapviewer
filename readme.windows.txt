First of all, why are you using windows?  I have not used it for years so had
forgotten how poor it is.  While sorting out the issues to get this application
working with windows I had to resurrect an old install of windows 98, it was
awful.  Please consider using a proper operating system like Linux
(www.linux.org).  OK, great, you're going to try Linux, we can stop here then...

What, you're still reading, you really ought to try something else. But hey, my
operating system is all about choice so who am I to judge you.  I will not
mention your folly again.

First of all, I assume you have a working install of Eternal Lands.  The default
configuration of this EL map viewer assumes you installed the game in its
default place.  You will have to modify the viewer configuration file if you did
not do that.

The viewer is written in the Python scripting language (www.python.org) so you
need to have a working install of that (assumed the default place again).  The 
viewer uses the pygame modules so you need that too.

Get python from "http://www.python.org/download/". I've tested version 2.4.3
"http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.3/python-2.4.3.msi"

This uses the microsoft installer which you may need to download from 
microsoft.  From their main site "Downloads->All Downloads->Windows Installer".
I used version 2 for 98.

Get the pygame modules from "http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml". I tested
version 1.7 "http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.7.1release.win32-py2.4.exe".

Now you're ready to run the viewer.  User the elmapviewer.bat script.

Hope you like it.
