# Moraf's idea for web based map marks:
# The directory must contain the file 'maplist' which is a simple text
# file with a lists of map files with marker files stored in the directory
# e.g. maplist could contain the line "map2.bmp" then the file "map2.elm.txt"
# will be in the web directory and contain mark information in the normal 
# marker file format - hope that all makes sense.
